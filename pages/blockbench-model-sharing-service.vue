			<h1>Model Sharing Service</h1>
			
			<p>When you share your Blockbench project using the sharing service, your project file will be uploaded to the Blockbench servers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>After the specified time is expired, the project will be completely and automatically removed from the servers.</li>
				<li>Uploading a model only stores the project file itself. Other than that, no personal information is saved.</li>
				<li>Other than accessing the model through the generated link, no third party will be able to access this data.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to me on the Blockbench Discord server <a href="https://discord.blockbench.net">https://discord.blockbench.net</a> or via email at info[at]blockbench.net.</p>
