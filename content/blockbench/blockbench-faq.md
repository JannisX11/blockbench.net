# Blockbench FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Blockbench free?

Yes, Blockbench is absolutely free! The project is open source and the website is funded by donations.

### Can I use Blockbench models in my (commercial) project?

Everything that you make with Blockbench is your artwork. Blockbench is just a tool. That means that you can use and redistribute anything made with Blockbench, even for commercial use.

### How Do I Get Started?

The [quick-start wizard](https://blockbench.net/quickstart) shows you which format to select and gives you useful informations, tutorials and resources for your specific needs.

### Where do I find error messages?

If there is an issue with either Blockbench itself or a plugin, you can see the error message in the Blockbench console. To see the console, press Control + Shift + I at the same time. In some cases you will not see the console directly, so you have to click on the "Console" tab. Include a screenshot of the error message in your bug report.

### The web app preview does not load. What can I do?

Make sure your browser is WebGL-compatible. Go to [get.webgl.org](https://get.webgl.org) and check if a cube appears. If it doesn't, update or switch your browser. The latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera should work.

If this doesn't help, it might be an individual problem with your graphics drivers.

### What limitations does the web-app have?

The web-app is a fully-functional version of the app. Only some import / export features require extra steps due to security features in browsers. Model import is still possible, but their textures have to be loaded manually.

### Is Blockbench available as a Mobile App?

Blockbench is available as a progressive web app. That means that you can install it directly from the browser, without the need to use an APK or go through an app store. You can find installation instructions on the [downloads page](https://blockbench.net/downloads/)

### How do I add background images/blueprints?

You can add background images to each camera angle in Blockbench. On orthographic camera angles, the background can be used as a blueprint for the model. To add a new background, right click in the preview and choose "Background > Load". After loading a background, right click again to position or remove the background.

### Why does my texture not show up correctly?

Make sure that you are loading textures from your hard drive. Loading textures from servers or usb drives can cause problems.

### Why is the Blockbench interface flickering and turning blurry?

This is an issue with your graphics settings. If you are using an Nvidia graphics card, open the Nvidia Control Panel, select "3D Settings" > "Manage 3D Settings" and disable "Antialiasing - FXAA". Click "Apply". The changes will show after you restart Blockbench.
