# Emissive Textures in Renders

## Introduction

You've probably seen some cool renders of models that stood out to you because parts of them glow. Perhaps you even wanted to try this out on some of your own models.

In order to make this guide as easy to follow along as possible, it has been broken down into three very broad sections:

1. Creating the model
2. Making the emissive texture
3. Exporting into a rendering software and configuring

Each of these broad steps will be explained in detail, providing some general knowledge and a few tips to help explain creating emissive renders. As well as explaining the required steps, this guide has an example in the form of a lamp post which will hopefully help with visualizing what to do.
